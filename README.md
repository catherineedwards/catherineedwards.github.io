# Hello!

Kia ora! This is my developer portfolio page to be hosted using Github pages.

Built with :heart: using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

## Goals
This project is to reflect how much I have learnt with software development so far, where I want to go, and share just how much I love learning.

Here's what I want to do along the way:
* Play with Ruby
* Build a Jekyll theme
* Get into the habit of regularly blogging
* Host my software development portfolio

## Upcoming blog posts
* How to set up Jekyll on Github pages
* Using Github pages with a custom domain
* How and why you should use Markdown
