Kia Ora! :wave: Thanks for visiting my little corner of the internet :house_with_garden:

I'm a web developer with skill, empathy, creativity and enthusiasm. I'm a multi-disciplinary person: I work comfortably in design, development, and delivery.

I am focussing on a long-term career change from business analysis to web development. I am doing this by:
* continuing self-study with relevant courses,
* practising coding by building web applications, and
* sharing my knowledge through this portfolio site.

I'm driven to build web applications that are innovative, resilient, scalable, and sustainable. I'm inspired to be challenged and learn something new about myself and modern ways of working in the tech industry. I have an appetite for continuous learning and self-improvement with my growth mindset, and the ever-evolving tech industry will always positively challenge me!

I've worked in organisations that have used Agile and DevOps to create work environments that enable teams to experiment in psychologically safe environments. I personally have achieved my best work in these teams, and I am looking for a developer role that empowers me to achieve even more. I value transparency, integrity, compassion and balance in teams I work in. I foster empathy, inclusivity and diversity in teams

I bring energy, excitement and humour wherever I go. Outside of work, I grow succulents (if you want some cuttings, let me know!), bake delightful desserts, powerlift at the gym, and volunteer for [DevOpsDays NZ](https://www.devopsdays.nz/) as part of the organising committee.
